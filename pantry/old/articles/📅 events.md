{🏺 history}

Events and periods that have happened throughout history. [🌐 The Pantry] is incredibly old, and this many of its histories are calculated in terms of ages, rather than concrete points in time.

Long stretches during which very little change happened occurred before the time of the [😇 gods], before the formation of the [🌍 planes], and after the [Aetivima Period].

The full [Consideration|Passage Consideration] timeline can be viewed [here|Full Consideration Timeline].
